              You Don't... Someone Else Will -</font></b> Imagine you are walking 
              down the street and see a ten-dollar bill lying on the sidewalk. 
              What do you do? Keep walking? Look for the money's owner? Or keep 
              it for yourself? In situations like this, it is helpful to remember 
              Ms. Number One: You. Somebody is going to be ten dollars richer 
              today, so why not you! It's called seizing the opportunity and as 
              a reporter, we are often faced with situations like this all the 
              time. If I don't film that famous movie star throwing up behind 
              the Viper Room, somebody else will and then I've missed out. I would 
              never be the star host of <i>Total Entertainment</i> today if I 
              didn't follow this important rule.</font></p>

              <font size="3"><b>Appearances Are Everything -</b></font> Success 
              is a self-fulfilling prophecy- if you look successful, you'll be 
              successful. Do you think the editor of got to the top wearing Prada 
              or Contempo? And how many ugly people are successful in Hollywood 
              besides Larry King and Harvey Weinstein? Answer: the big donut. 
              Zero! Stay in shape, dress good, and spend a few extra dollars on 
              good makeup and the best salons. <br>
              Sleep is for the weak. - Somebody pretty smart once said: "There 
              are no days off in life." So true! Sleep is the biggest waste of 
              time. Cats spend 75% of their lives asleep, which may be why they 
              have never accomplished anything beyond the litter box. Look at 
              the daily habits of the most successful people and you'll see they 
              almost never sleep. Yours truly gets about four hours a night, which 
              is more than enough. Puff Daddy only dozes three hours a night, 
              and even then he wears his telephone headset! </font></p>

              <font size="3"><b>Be Ferociously Persistent</b></font> - Another 
              famous person, Virgil something or other, once told me: "Fortune 
              favors the bold". In other words, you've got to go after what you 
              want, no matter what the costs. Eliminate the word "quit" from your 
              vocabulary, along with the words "guilt", "remorse", and "conscience". 
              Some people might call a persistent person like you or me "annoying" 
              but ignore them; they just haven't realized how important we are 
              yet.</font></p>

              Black Eyes Go Away; Pulitzer Prizes Don't - </b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">People 
              always ask me: "Gale, what's with all the fist-fights?" I always 
              answer with the above motto. The world of news thrives on drama, 
              and that means conflict. Part of any good story involves surprising, 
              and confronting, the subject, often in a compromising situation. 
              Generally, people don't respond well to a reporter jumping out of 
              their bedroom closet or the trunk of their car, but it makes for 
              great footage. And if I have to take a punch to serve public's "need 
              to know", then that is a small price to pay for the truth.</font></p>

              <font size="3"><b>Set Demanding Goals -</b></font> If you want to 
              climb Everest, do you practice on your front steps? Of course not. 
              You find the highest mountain around and you hike until you pass 
              out. You can get far in life if you just push yourself. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font size="3"><br>
              Never, Ever Say You're Sorry - </font></b>Nothing sounds lamer than 
              the words "I'm sorry". As soon as you apologize to someone, you 
              have admitted fault and given them the upper hand. In my opinion, 
              everyone apologizes too much. For instance, look at the British- 
              every other word out of their mouths is "sorry" and look how pathetic 
              they're country is. All they have left is a queen and a couple islands. 
              I only say "sorry" when I mean it. Which is almost never. It wasn't 
              my fault Amanda Oxens was an anorexic, so why should I apologize 
              for reporting it? </font></p>
