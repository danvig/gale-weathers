                    of a crop of acclaimed music video directors to make the jump

                    with Mr. Bridger at the helm. Because of his cult following 
                    on MTV, many feel that Roman defines hip, cool and edgy within 
                    the wonderful world of popular culture. Whether putting rapper 
                    Eminime in a polar bear suit on a New York City street or 
                    dropping Jewel into the Sahara desert, this director is always 
                    breaking trends and cutting edges. I sat down with the flirtatious 
                    Mr. Bridger in his suite at the Beverly Hills Meridian to 
                    talk to him about styles, love, and, of course, <i><a href="http://www.scream3.com" target="_blank">Stab

                    Well, my agent, <b>Beverly Choi</b>, is good friends with 
                    super producer <b>John Milton</b> and she heard that he was 
                    looking for someone fresh to direct this picture. Beverly 
                    sold him on me with my reel and he, in turn, sold Sunrise 
                    on my skills. It's just been a whirlwind to be honest with 
                    you.</font>

                    First, let me say that no one will be able to replace or one-up 
                    Jerry. I grew up on him and he is the king of horror. I'm 
                    just glad that I have the honor of following in his footsteps. 
                    It's really such a shame that we can't communicate about <a href="http://www.scream3.com" target="_blank"><i>Stab 
                    3</i></a> because I'd love to hear his input on the flick. 
                    In terms of me, I feel that I bring urban smarts and cutting 
                    edge energy to all of my projects. I think that overall my 
                    kinetic camera work will really add to the series. I'm looking 
                    forward to putting my fingerprint on the picture. </font>

                    I try not to date directors, too many casting couch temptations.

                    I have a two-picture deal with Sunrise so I'm hoping to get 
                    my Hip-Hop musical <i>Calling All Homies</i> off the ground 
                    there. It's actually a wonderful story about a down on his 
                    luck plumber who finds his shinning star in the rap game. 
                    It was written by my personal favorite rapper O'Sell'Ya. </font>

                    Oh, it's really phat. Then, I have a comedy in the works for 
                    Def Jam that will star Def Jef and, hopefully, SHAQ. I can 
                    only say that it's the Karate Kid of the hip-hop genre. </font>

                    to the mic, Gale. I could do your video. You'd be a real pleasure
