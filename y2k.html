              No More Miss Nice Guy:</font></B><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
              <br>
              Last year, I noticed that every now and then, some jerk would cut 
              me off on the freeway while I was rushing to grab the next headline. 
              Usually, my response was to begin a full-scale investigative report 
              into this guy's life, but lately, I don't even write down the license 
              plate number! Worse, I've noticed that sometimes, a celebrity will 
              answer my questions with "no comment" and I will just accept it! 
              Well, that's all gonna change. I may have had a sunny disposition 
              last year, but that does not mean I'm getting soft. Nobody can "control 
              the Weathers." Nobody! </font> 
            <P align="center"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Double 
              My Workout:</B> <br>
              Between you and me, I've noticed a little flab under my arms and 
              on my thighs. Totally unacceptable. In a business where looks are 
              almost everything, I'm not getting any younger. All the more reason 
              to crank up the Stairmaster. </font> 
            <P align="center"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>More 
              "Me" Time:</B> <br>
              Last year, the <i>Top Story</i> van broke down on the 405 freeway 
              and and was almost an hour late to pick me up. I used that time 
              to write a letter to my mom and to call my credit card company about 
              an erroneous charge. That one hour to myself was really satisfying! 
              This year, I'm going to call in sick for half a day. Maybe I'll 
              sleep in until 7:30 or walk my dog for the first time! (Don't tell 
              my boss!) </font> 
            <P align="center"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Double 
              The Danger:</B> <br>
              In 1999, I was punched fourteen times in the face, named in six 
              lawsuits, arrested nine times, and ended up in the emergency room 
              five times. That is just not acceptable! I usually end up in jail 
              at least once a month, and my lawyer had way too much time on his 
              hands. When did I become such a wuss? Y2Gail is going to bring back 
              that "win at all costs", "take no prisoners" attitude that put me 
              on top of the journalist heap. </font> 
            <P align="center"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Three 
              Words:</B> <br>
              Emmy Emmy Emmy. I've waited long enough, and dammit, this is my 
              year to stand on the stage and to thank myself for all the hard 
              work I've done over the years. I don't care if I have to pull a 
              "Tonya Harding" on Diane Sawyer, I'm getting that thing with the 
              gold lady holding up the globe. </font>
