                    American pie-wholesome heartthrob. So, why does everyone think 
                    he's a such a rebel? Maybe they don't trust his cute demeanor. 
                    Perhaps his rumored wayward lifestyle enters minds. Or, maybe, 
                    just maybe, he seems too good to be true. I sat down with 
                    him last week to get to the bottom of the rumors. </font>

                    I just finished a great little picture with a really cool 
                    director named Daze Hollander. It's called <a href="http://www.scream3.com" target="_blank"><i>Mosquitoes 
                    Take Manhattan</i></a>. All my fans are gonna' love it. I 
                    play a New York Transit worker who gets stuck on a train with 
                    Erica Clive's character during a huge Mosquito invasion in 
                    the Big Apple. I join forces with Tom Prinze to battle the 
                    insects and try to restore safety to the city. I just saw 
                    a rough cut at Daze's place, it's a really rad flick! </font>

                    those naked panic dreams you get in high school. I dreamt 
                    that I was on set with Daze and Amanda (Oxens) and we were 
                    doing a serious scene where I tell Amanda that I have cancer. 
                    Only thing is, I realize half-way through the scene that I 
                    forgot to put on clothes. I look around and the whole crew 
                    is laughing and pointing. It was really embarrassing until 
                    I finally woke up and realized it was just a nightmare. <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="images/scream3_sp_135.gif" width="197" height="174" align="right"></font></font>

                    I'm seeing a great woman - her name's Lynn McKay. She's beautiful, 
                    she's fantastic and I think she could be a great actress if 
                    she wanted. I met her when I was filming the final scenes 
                    of <a href="http://www.scream3.com" target="content"><i>Mosquitoes 
                    Take Manhattan</i></a> on the <a href="http://www.scream3.com" target="content"><i>Sunrise

                    I'm good! Who was the most impressive person you ever met? 
                    DP Definitely Sidney Prescott. When I was prepping<i> <a href="http://www.scream3.com" target="content">Stab 
                    2</a></i>, I went out with Tori (Spelling) to Sid's college 
                    in Cincinnati to go over some of the emotions that she had 
                    experienced in her ordeal. I found her to be so real and honest. 
                    I mean I don't know how she remains so calm and collected 
                    after all the tragedy that she's encountered over her lifetime. 
                    Sidney was not only a great source of material for the film, 
                    but she was a wonderful inspiration to me. </font> 
                  <p> <i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font size="3"><b>G:</b></font> 
                    Yeah, Ms. Prescott is a very interesting, independent young 
                    woman. So, what was the biggest practical joke you have ever 
                    pulled on someone? </font></i> 
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <font size="2">In 
                    high school, me and a bunch of homies got together and stole 
                    a key to the main office. It was one of those offices that's 
                    on the second floor and there's only two sets of staircases 
                    to get there. We filled Dixie Cups with water and lined all 
                    the stairs on both sides with them. That way, no one could 
                    walk up the stairs until someone got rid of at least half 
                    the cups of water. The teachers found it early and took care 
                    of the problem before first bell. We were peeved 'cause we 
                    thought that we could halt school, but it didn't work. Oh, 
                    well. There was a big investigation about who did it, but 
                    no one fessed up. I guess they know now.</font></font>
