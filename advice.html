            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>1. Raw Red 
              Meat</b> - I know that this one sounds pretty yucky, but it really 
              works. Besides, you know what I always say, "You've got to sacrifice 
              to stay on top." </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>2. Sliced 
              Cucumbers</b> - I picked this one up from an old, wild starlet friend 
              of mine, Danielle Rangler (she swears by it). I've found that a 
              little lemon juice on the cucs really help the healing process. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>3. Sun-Tan 
              Machine</b> - An obvious counter-balance choice, if you're a person 
              who doesn't like to deal with issues directly. Just tan the rest 
              of your face to match the blemish and you'll be golden. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>4. MAC blush 
              (skin-tone)</b> - A great product! My favorite employees, Joan and 
              Sue, at the MAC store in the Beverly Center can help you pick out 
              the style and color that is best for your personal skin color. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>5. Ice Pack</b> 
              - Old fashioned, but very reliable. I suggest alternating cold and 
              hot packs on the eye for the first twenty-four hours after the punch 
              (assuming this is how you got your black eye). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>6. Aesop's 
              Homeopathetic Eye Rub</b> - Tough to find this plant-based formula, 
              but some really good health food stores (I love Bread & Circus) 
              carry it. Just follow Aesop's directions on the back of the jar 
              and, walla, the black eye is gone in less than two days.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> <b>7. Mud</b> 
              - This may seem odd and a bit gross, but it's my grandmother Lola's 
              old recipe and it really helps your skin heal any blemish. I've 
              been using it under Lola's watchful eye almost since birth. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>8. Versace 
              Eye Liner</b> - Good for a small shiner. If you have a very small 
              or easily hidden black eye, consider a little extra eye liner to 
              shield the injury. I have to say that I'm so glad that Versace started 
              producing make-up. Thanks, guys! </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>9. Face, 
              Stockholm Facial Scrub</b> - The genderless packaging of Face's 
              Great Yellow Moisturizer and Facial Scrub is a great black eye tool 
              that you can use regardless of sex. Boys will not be afraid to pick 
              it up at a department store and it should be in any intelligent, 
              successful girl's medicine cabinet. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>10. Duck!</b> 
              - This is the only true tell way to avoid a black eye.</font></p>

              television and the entertainment business as a whole, but some people 
              in my town say that my nose is a little too large for this type 
              of career. Should I have some work done on my looks if I want to

              </font></b><font size="3">Cindy, while I have never had any surgery 
              personally, I know a lot of gals in Hollywood who have and it has 
              aided their careers immensely. If a nose job is the difference between 
              success on camera or a mediocre life in Louisville, I'd say for 
              my money, get the plastic surgery. If you can't find a good doctor 
              down south, let me know, I might be able to point you in the right 
              direction out in Los Angeles.</font></font></p>

              <font size="3"><b>My boyfriend is moving in with me because his 
              lease is up. Though I'm excited, and it makes sense from a money 
              pov, I really desired to be engaged before we took this large step. 
              Jimmy says that he's too busy with his new business to even think 
              about rings and decisions right now. On top of it all, my parents 
              and grandparents are less than thrilled with the idea of the two 
              of us living together unwed. Gale, what would you suggest I do?

              <font size="3">Sure, you'll save a little cash on the move-in, but 
              at what larger cost? Your parents might be old fashionable, but 
              if Jimmy's moving-in makes you feel uncomfortable, than think about 
              helping him find his own place. Tell him about your expectations 
              and your feelings about the next step in the relationship. This 
              is a great chance to see if you two are on the same life page. If 
              he can't address your needs, than you might want to think about 
              where this relationship is really headed. Maybe, it has indeed run 
              out of steam. If so, it's better to know now rather than down the 
              road when he's leaving the toilet seat up in your place. Besides, 
              you know what I always say, "It's better to be single and determined, 
              than attached and without aspiration."</font></font></p>

              Lawrence, in awhile. He's such a talented young man both in front 
              of the camera and behind the microphone. I've always been a huge 
              fan and it would be great to know what he's up to lately.<br>

              off, call me Gale (Ms. Weathers is so formal for my fans). In answer 
              to your question, Joey's career is alive and well. After his hit 
              record and syndicated television work, he took a little time off 
              from the business to focus on his personal life. After the brief 
              hiatus, Joey returned to the small screen with roles in several 
              successful television movies and a recurring position as the top 
              left corner square in the immensely popular television show Hollywood 
              Squares. Luckily for all his fans out there, Joey is back in the 
              recording studio laying down tracks for a rap album (it should be 
              fat!). Mr. Lawrence is also currently developing several feature 
              films with his production company. One of these films,<i> Runaway 
              Alley</i>. he plans to star in and direct. </font></font></p>
